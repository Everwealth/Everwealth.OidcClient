# OIDC Client for Xamarin

OIDC Client for Xamarin-based iOS and Android mobile applications.

This library is based on the [Auth0 OIDC client](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-oidc-client-net), which makes use of the the [IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient2](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient2) library and uses code from the [IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient.Samples](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient.Samples) repository to achieve browser integration.

Although this library is different from the Auth0 version, some information on the quickstart guide may be helpful:
